# Radar

requirements:-

ultrasonic sensor.
arduino.
servo.
jumpers.
arduino IDE.
processing software.

here there are two files radar_processing and servo_processing.
radar_processing is the processing file which can be opened through processing software.
link:- 


servo_processing is an arduino file. which controls the servo.


this is a radar which is used to detect the object within its range. here ultrasonic sensor is placed on the servo and the servo is rotated
between certain angles.

side by side processing software will genrate a radar image with green lines showing that there is no object and red lines showing that an
object is being detected.
